### Abstract

Traditional music-listening studies are often conducted using short, artificial stimuli unrepresentative of the natural, everyday contexts in which people typically engage with music. Such laboratory conditions limit the generalizability of findings and fail to tell us about the dynamic and unfolding nature of real-world music experiences. To address these limitations, we developed a method to non-invasively measure the photoplethysmogram (PPG) from multiple individuals, simultaneously, during live events. The present work outlines the system components and architecture. We aimed to produce a versatile, robust, and relatively low-cost system, by utilizing Bangle.js smartwatches (equipped with a touchscreen, Bluetooth connectivity, and a PPG sensor). We developed a custom watch application that collects raw PPG samples at 25 Hz for up to 3 hours. This application provides a precise time series of pulse rate data allowing for the extraction of several cardiac metrics. We also developed a watch dashboard that can control and monitor multiple watches remotely via Bluetooth. The dashboard simplifies the management of multiple devices in time-sensitive conditions (such as live concerts) and reduces the need to disrupt engaged participants, in the event of a problem. By capturing data in everyday contexts, we hope to bridge the gap between controlled experiments and real-world music listening. The use of familiar, wearable technology increases adoption of and access to physiological measurements. This approach empowers researchers to study diverse populations in naturalistic environments and opens new avenues for exploring how music influences emotions, social interactions, and well-being over extended periods.
