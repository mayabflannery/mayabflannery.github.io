## Research Experience

### Digital Music Lab, McMaster University

Doctoral Research (In progress) -- Model music preference with respect to personality, mood, familiarity, complexity, and music acoustic features.

Collaborative work (In progress) -- Extract music features from live and prerecorded audio tracks; investigate relationship with audience’s head movement.

Master's Thesis (2022) -- Developed and tested manipulable and objectively measurable *music acoustic features* for use in music classification and description.

Honours Thesis (2020) -- Investigated correlation of personality factors and music preference with systematic manipulation of musical stimuli.

Research Practicum (2019) -- Examined music listening behaviour with analysis of a large dataset.

Research Practicum (2019) -- Investigated memory for musical key; assisted  with  creation  of  musical  stimuli;  conducted experiments with participants; programmed analysis of data.

### LIVE Lab, McMaster University

Lab Assistant (2018) -- Supported research projects with design, set up, execution, and clean up of experiments. Demonstrated lab technology: Active acoustics, Yamaha Disklavier piano, motion capture, live physiological response. Led tours for general public, colleges, high schools, day camps. Supported live performances: 10dB Concert series.
